# Scoop-mtb

[![Tests](https://github.com/melmass/scoop-mtb/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/melmass/scoop-mtb/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/melmass/scoop-mtb/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/melmass/scoop-mtb/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

## Usage

Just add this repo as a bucket:
```sh
scoop bucket add mtb https://github.com/melMass/scoop-mtb.git
```
## If you want to contribute
You need to install pre-commit to avoid unneeded back and forth on things that can be detected programmatically (most rules come from Scoop "guidelines")
```sh
# the repo uses pre-commit (pip install pre-commit)
pre-commit install
```
